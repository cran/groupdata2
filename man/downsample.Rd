\title{Downsampling of rows in a data frame.}
\usage{
downsample(data, cat_col, id_col = NULL, id_method = "n_ids")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame.}

\item{cat_col}{Name of categorical variable to balance by. (Character)}

\item{id_col}{Name of factor with IDs. (Character)

IDs are considered entities, e.g. allowing us to add or remove all rows for an ID.
How this is used is up to the \code{id_method}.

E.g. If we have measured a participant multiple times and
want make sure that we keep all these measurements. Then we would either
remove/add all measurements for the participant or leave in
all measurements for the participant.}

\item{id_method}{Method for balancing the IDs. (Character)

\code{n_ids}, \code{n_rows_c}, \code{distributed}, or \code{nested}.
\subsection{n_ids (default)}{
Balances on ID level only. It makes sure there are the same number of IDs for each category.
This might lead to a different number of rows between categories.
}
\subsection{n_rows_c}{
Attempts to level the number of rows per category, while only removing/adding entire IDs.
This is done in 2 steps:
\enumerate{
\item If a category needs to add all its rows one or more times, the data is repeated.
\item Iteratively, the ID with the number of rows closest to the
lacking/excessive number of rows is added/removed.
This happens until adding/removing the closest ID would lead to a size further from
the target size than the current size.
If multiple IDs are closest, one is randomly sampled.
}
}
\subsection{distributed}{
Distributes the lacking/excess rows equally between the IDs.
If the number to distribute can not be equally divided, some IDs will have 1 row more/less than the others.
}
\subsection{nested}{
Calls \code{balance()} on each category with IDs as cat_col.

I.e. if size is \code{"min"}, IDs will have the size of the smallest ID in their category.
}}
}
\value{
Data frame with some rows removed. Ordered by \code{cat_col} and (potentially) \code{id_col}.
}
\description{
\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{lifecycle::badge("maturing")}

Uses random downsampling to fix the group sizes to the
smallest group in the data frame.

Wraps \code{\link{balance}()}.
}
\details{
\subsection{Without \code{id_col}}{
Downsampling is done without replacement, meaning that rows are not duplicated but only removed.}
\subsection{With \code{id_col}}{See \code{id_method} description.}

# Attach packages
library(groupdata2)

# Create data frame
df <- data.frame(
  "participant" = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5)),
  "diagnosis" = factor(c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)),
  "trial" = c(1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4),
  "score" = sample(c(1:100), 13)
)

# Using downsample()
downsample(df, cat_col = "diagnosis")

# Using downsample() with id_method "n_ids"
# With column specifying added rows
downsample(df,
  cat_col = "diagnosis",
  id_col = "participant",
  id_method = "n_ids"
)

# Using downsample() with id_method "n_rows_c"
# With column specifying added rows
downsample(df,
  cat_col = "diagnosis",
  id_col = "participant",
  id_method = "n_rows_c"
)

# Using downsample() with id_method "distributed"
downsample(df,
  cat_col = "diagnosis",
  id_col = "participant",
  id_method = "distributed"
)

# Using downsample() with id_method "nested"
downsample(df,
